### Hello there 👋

I am a french developer who loves well-designed and well-documented code, but mostly loves beer and cheese. 🍺 🧀

I am willing to improve the open-source community around orchestration and auto-scaling.


My skills' list and contact are available [here](https://resume.rico.ovh/). 📫


I currently work as a Kubernetes lead software engineer [@OVHcloud](ovhcloud.com). ⛅️
